# Two-elevator-project-in-CODESYS
## A project containing the working principle of two elevators simultaneously in CODESYS written  in Structured Text (ST)

This project is built upon that with the link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWNOlQFlAN4&t=262s&ab_channel=TohidAlizadeh. 

The project above contained a logic for one elevator. This project has the logic for two elevators, which follow several rules of having of one a higher priority over another in different circumstances.

Please, watch a video description to undestand the principle of work of the code.

Good luck!
